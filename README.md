# PlanetHorse+ v1.0.1

A Chrome extension that displays real-time multi-currency conversion for your PH tokens on [Planet Horse](https://planethorse.io). Support for USD, EUR, ARS (fiat currencies) plus RON (token) with an interactive currency selector.

Built with **WXT Framework** and **TypeScript** for modern, fast development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

## What is Planet Horse?

### Development Workflow

#### **Fast Development with HMR:**
1. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   ‚Üí **Auto-opens Chrome** at `https://planethorse.io/game`  
   ‚Üí **Extension pre-loaded** and ready for testing  
   ‚Üí **Zero manual setup** required!

2. **Make changes**: Edit files in `src/content/` 
3. **Auto-reload**: Extension automatically updates with your changes!

#### **Production Build:**
1. **Build extension**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Test build**: Manually load `.output/chrome-mv3/` in Chrome for production testing
3. **Create ZIP for store**:
   ```bash
   npm run zip
   ```
